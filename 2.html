    <h3>Essay 2 (에세이 2)</h3>
    <h4><Strong>Bilingual means the ability to speak two or more languages fluently.</strong></h4>
         They get some advantages.
         <p>First, They have more tool which is able to use in communication. It's like they can see through double windows whereas other people can see only one window. So There's way more information they can get and also can show themself to more people than who's not Bilingual.</p>
         <p>Second, I think bilingual people are more flexible and receptive to other culture. The reason is that Bilingual is not simply speaking two or more language. They're equally good at different languages. languages don't be learned from just reading textbooks. Language learning is followed by learning that culture. So Bilinguals, who can fluently speak other languages, They get different cultures melting in their mind too. Therefore If they face another culture, they can soak it up easily.</p>
