    <h3>Essay 3 (에세이 3)</h3>
    <h4><Strong>What would you say is the <U>worst thing about the internet?</U></strong></h4>

        <p>I think The most worst thing about the internet is that It’s too easy to spread fake news, or rumor. People can get so much information surprisingly easily. But most of them don't have any source or reference. People even don't try to verify that's true. They just upload some information indiscriminately which is sometimes just their assumption or thought and In another place, someone sees that then just trust it. It’s disaster. Besides, these kinds of fake news and rumor are not deleted long as well.</p>
        <p>So, as time passes, more people are deceived. Furthermore, Even if that news is true, If It would be about Privacy, It's able to go to criminal. That’s worse than simply fake news. So, the internet makes us possible to get huge information but on the other hand, If we don't use it carefully we'll be completely taken in by scam.</p>
