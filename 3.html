    <h3>Essay 3 (에세이 3)</h3>
    <h4><Strong>The person I admire, King Sejong.</strong></h4>

        <p> For me, the first person that pops into my mind when I think of leaders I admire is King Sejong. Sejong is one of the kings of the Josun Dynasty, old name of Korea. He was in the supreme position, the king. However, He never abused his power, Rather he always kept thinking about what he can do for taking care of his nation. He hired Jang who was born in a slave to develop science technology. He didn't care about the background of a person. Then they invented the world's first water gauge. And The sundial, water clock and Korea’s own calendar is also invented in the era of King Sejong. In history book, it says “King Sejong has been studying hard every day. He only sleeps 5 hours a day.” Finally he invented a unique Korean alphabet as known as The Hangeul, our own character. At that time, Koreans were using Chinese characters and it was too hard to study. So only a few people in higher status could learn and read and write. Most of the nobles opposed that making Korean own alphabet because if there's an easier alphabet they would lose privilege. But King Sejong invented Hangeul himself. So after then, even normal people could read and write very easily with our own alphabet, which means they could be educated, they could express something unfair and record culture or whatever. </p>
